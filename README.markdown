# My dotfiles #
Yay!

## Actions not yet in dotfiles repo ##

- Auto symlinking the files
- Powerline fonts for terminal
- Colour scheme for terminal

The choice of agnoster for a theme pretty much needs the powerline fonts (otherwise it's ugly) and also is pretty ugly without the font (13pt Menlo Regular for Powerline) which is included in my fonts repo.
